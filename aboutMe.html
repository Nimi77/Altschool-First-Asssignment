    <div class="body">
        <p>My name is Oladejo, Abimbola Toluwanimi, I'm currently enrolled in school of engineering
            at Altschool and my selected track is Frontend Engineering.<br> My student ID is ALT/SOE/023/3804.<br>
            One of the reasons why I'm in Altschool is to enhance my web developer skill and most especially to get better with writing
            Javascript<br> and to learn frameworks under Frontend Developement with the guidance of a mentor. 
            <br>Through Altschool I want to become a better software engineer and also be able to present my skill 
            when its time to go job hunting.
