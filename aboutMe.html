        <span>About me</span>

    <div class="body">
        <p>My name is Oladejo, Abimbola Toluwanimi, I'm currently enrolled in school of engineering
            at Altschool and my selected track is Frontend Engineering.<br> My student ID is ALT/SOE/023/3804.<br>
            One of the reasons why I'm in Altschool is to enhance my web developer skill and most especially to get better with writing
            Javascript<br> and to learn frameworks under Frontend Developement with the guidance of a mentor. 
            <br>Through Altschool I want to become a better software engineer and also be able to present my skill 
            when its time to go job hunting.
            <!-- I'm a citizen of Nigeria and I currently reside in the South eastern side of
            the country. I'm a student studying in one of Nigeria's best state university (as we were told).
            Some of my favourite things to do are: reading books(60%), listening to music with reasonable lyrics
            watching videos on trying new food recipes (on Twitter) which I might try out. My career aspiration 
            is to become a software engineer and to work with one of the best tech company in Nigeria.
            This might not go well with my aspiration but I hope to visit countries outside Nigeria and travel around the world. -->
